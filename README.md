**Intern Intelligence: First Week Cybersecurity Report**

**Exploring OWASP Juice Shop**

### **Introduction**
Cybersecurity is a crucial field in today’s digital age, with web application security being a key component. As part of my first-week task in Intern Intelligence, I had the opportunity to explore OWASP Juice Shop, a deliberately vulnerable web application designed to help security enthusiasts learn about real-world vulnerabilities. This report documents my experiences, findings, and insights gained while working on brute force attacks and SQL injection.

### **Understanding OWASP Juice Shop**
OWASP Juice Shop is an open-source web application that serves as a security training platform. It contains numerous vulnerabilities that reflect real-world scenarios, providing a safe environment for security testing. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, cybersecurity professionals can better understand potential threats and mitigation techniques.

### **Brute Force Attack Analysis**
#### **Overview**
A brute force attack is a method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying different username-password combinations until the correct credentials are found. This type of attack exploits weak password policies and the absence of account lockout mechanisms.

#### **Methodology**
To conduct a brute force attack on OWASP Juice Shop, I used Burp Suite’s Sniper attack mode:
- **Step 1:** Captured login request traffic using Burp Suite.
- **Step 2:** Loaded a password dictionary containing commonly used passwords.
- **Step 3:** Configured Burp Intruder to iterate through password attempts.
- **Step 4:** Monitored responses to identify a successful login attempt.

#### **Findings**
- Weak password policies allowed easy exploitation.
- Lack of account lockout or rate limiting increased vulnerability.
- Response time variations revealed potential clues for valid credentials.

#### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Implement strong password policies requiring complex and unique passwords.
- Introduce account lockout mechanisms to limit failed login attempts.
- Use CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks.

### **SQL Injection Exploitation**
#### **Overview**
SQL injection is a technique used to manipulate SQL queries executed by a web application, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the database.

#### **Methodology**
Using a SQL injection vulnerability in the login page, I executed the following payload:
```
' OR 1=1 --
```
This altered the SQL query structure, allowing access without valid credentials.

#### **Findings**
- The application lacked input validation, making it susceptible to SQL injection.
- Poorly constructed SQL queries exposed sensitive data.
- Authentication bypass was possible due to missing security measures.

#### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent query manipulation.
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
- Apply least privilege principles to database access.

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Security Awareness:** Even basic security misconfigurations can lead to serious breaches.
2. **Importance of Best Practices:** Secure coding practices are essential to mitigate common vulnerabilities.
3. **Proactive Defense:** Continuous security testing and monitoring are necessary to stay ahead of attackers.

### **Conclusion**
My first week at Intern Intelligence provided valuable insights into web application security. By working with OWASP Juice Shop, I learned the importance of identifying vulnerabilities and implementing robust security measures. This exercise reinforced the need for proactive security approaches in real-world applications.

### **Future Exploration**
In the upcoming weeks, I aim to explore additional vulnerabilities such as:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Broken Authentication

By diving deeper into these areas, I will continue to enhance my cybersecurity skills and contribute to securing web applications effectively.
